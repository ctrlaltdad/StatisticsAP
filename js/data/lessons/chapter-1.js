                <p>In the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, the Imperium of Man spans a million worlds. To govern such a vast empire, the Adeptus Administratum must collect and analyze data from every corner of the galaxy.</p>

                    <p>Imagine you're a Planetary Governor who needs to know how many Space Marines are stationed across different sectors. This requires systematic <strong>data collection</strong>.</p>

                <p>Statistics begins with gathering information. Just as the Emperor's servants catalog everything from troop movements to resource production, we must learn the sacred art of data collection.</p>

                <p>The Imperium cannot survey every citizen on every world. Instead, we use <strong>sampling</strong> - selecting a representative portion of the population.</p>
