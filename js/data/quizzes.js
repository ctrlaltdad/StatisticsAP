                question: "A Planetary Governor wants to assess the morale of all Imperial Guard regiments in the sector. Due to time constraints, they decide to survey only the regiments stationed at the capital hive city. What type of bias does this introduce?",
                options: [
                    "Voluntary response bias",

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "This is selection bias because the sample (capital regiments) is not representative of the population (all regiments in the sector). Capital regiments might have different characteristics than those stationed elsewhere.",

                correct: 3,

                question: "Five Space Marine squads report the following enemy kills: 8, 12, 15, 18, 22. An enemy artillery strike eliminates one squad with 8 kills from the data. How does this affect the mean and median of the remaining squads?",

                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "While both have the same mean (80), Regiment A has lower variability (range = 10) compared to Regiment B (range = 40), making Regiment A more consistent and reliable.",
