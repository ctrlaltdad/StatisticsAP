## 🔧 RECENT BUG FIXES

### Quiz Completion Error (July 20, 2025)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: `completeQuiz is not a function` error when completing quizzes
- **Root Cause**: QuizComponent was calling non-existent `progressManager.completeQuiz()` method
- **Solution**: Changed to use correct `progressManager.completeChapter()` method with proper parameters
- **Files Modified**: `js/components/QuizComponent.js`
- **Documentation**: Created `QUIZ_COMPLETION_BUGFIX.md` with detailed fix information
- **Impact**: Quiz completion now works correctly and progress is properly saved

### Navigation Error (July 20, 2025)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: `showChapter is not a function` error when clicking "Continue to Next Chapter"
- **Root Cause**: Event listener was calling non-existent `showChapter()` method in app-refactored.js
- **Solution**: Replaced with `showScreen('chapter-selection')` to take users back to chapter selection
- **Files Modified**: `js/app-refactored.js`
- **Documentation**: Created `NAVIGATION_BUGFIX.md` with detailed fix information
- **Impact**: "Continue to Next Chapter" button now works without errors

### Chapter Unlock Error (July 20, 2025)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Completing a quiz did not unlock the next chapter in the UI
- **Root Cause**: QuizComponent was emitting wrong event (`'quizCompleted'` instead of `'chapter:completed'`) and calling `progressManager.completeChapter()` directly, bypassing the event system that triggers UI updates
- **Solution**: Changed QuizComponent to emit `EVENTS.CHAPTER_COMPLETED` and removed direct progress calls, allowing the centralized `onChapterCompleted()` handler to manage progress and UI updates
- **Files Modified**: `js/components/QuizComponent.js`
- **Documentation**: Created `CHAPTER_UNLOCK_BUGFIX.md` with detailed fix information
- **Impact**: Chapters now properly unlock and UI updates immediately when quiz is completed
