// Example: Adding New Quiz Questions
// This example shows how to add quiz questions to the new modular system

// 1. To add questions to an existing quiz, edit js/data/quizzes.js:

const QUIZ_DATA = {
    // Existing chapters...
    
    4: { // New Chapter 4 Quiz

                question: "A Space Marine squad has an 80% chance of successfully completing each mission phase. If they need to complete 3 phases, what's the probability they complete all phases successfully?",

// 2. The QuizComponent will automatically:
//    - Load the new quiz data
//    - Shuffle questions and options
//    - Handle scoring and feedback
//    - Track progress
//    - Show results and rank assessment

// 3. To add the quiz to a chapter, edit js/data/chapters.js:

const CHAPTERS_DATA = {
    // Existing chapters...
    
    4: {
        id: 4,
        title: "Probability & Battle Odds",
        description: "Master the mathematics of uncertainty in the grim darkness of the far future.",
        difficulty: "Veteran Sergeant",
        estimatedTime: "45 min",
        topics: [
            "Independent Events",
            "Expected Value", 
            "Conditional Probability",
            "Law of Total Probability",
            "Battle Outcome Analysis"
        ],
        concepts: [
            "Multiplication Rule",
            "Expected Value Calculation",
            "Probability Trees",
            "Conditional Probability",
            "Risk Assessment"
        ],

// 5. Adding Custom Difficulty Levels:
//    Edit js/data/config.js to add new ranks:

const APP_CONFIG = {
    ranks: [
        { min: 95, title: "Primarch", icon: "üëë", description: "Legendary mastery of statistical warfare" },
        { min: 90, title: "Chapter Master", icon: "‚≠ê", description: "Exceptional tactical analysis" },
        // ... existing ranks
    ]
};

// The new modular architecture makes it easy to:
// ‚úÖ Add new quiz questions by editing data files
// ‚úÖ Create new quizzes for new chapters
// ‚úÖ Customize scoring and ranking systems
// ‚úÖ Add new question types and formats
// ‚úÖ Implement advanced features like time limits
// ‚úÖ Track detailed analytics and progress

console.log('üìö Quiz system ready for expansion!');
