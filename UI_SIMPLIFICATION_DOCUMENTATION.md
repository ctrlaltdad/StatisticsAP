# UI Simplification: Removed Faction Selection

## Issue Identified
**Problem:** The welcome screen had 3 faction choices (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Adeptus Mechanicus) that all led to the same content, creating unnecessary complexity and confusion for users.

**Date Fixed:** July 20, 2025

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced Faction Selection with Story Introduction
- **Before:** Three faction cards requiring selection before proceeding
- **After:** Compelling story introduction that leads directly to chapters

### 2. New Story Content
The new welcome screen features:
- **Imperial Archive Entry:** Immersive lore-based introduction
- **Mission Context:** Explains the user's role as a Statistical Order initiate
- **Journey Preview:** Shows what users will learn across chapters
- **Direct Call-to-Action:** Single button to begin the learning journey

### 3. Story Structure
```
ðŸ“œ Imperial Archive Entry 40.999.M41
â†’ Context about data in the Imperium
â†’ Introduction to Statistical Order
â†’ User's mission and purpose
â†’ Visual journey roadmap
â†’ Begin Statistical Crusade button
```

## Files Modified
